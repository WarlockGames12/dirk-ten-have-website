                <h4>This game was made intentially for a phone with a working microphone. I had alot of fun working on this game, because of the screaming controller. </h4>
                <h4>This game was a first for me for working with different controllers, we had alot of ideas making a game with different controllers. Like we had a idea to make a grappling hook VR game, but we didn't had any VR Headsets, that made it very hard to make one. We even made some concept art for it: </h4>
                <img style="width: 25%; border-radius: 10px;" src="images/ConceptArt.png">
                <h4>Then we decided to make a game where you control it with your phone to the PC and a controller that could accelerate speed with a paddle. but we scrapped the paddle idea and went forth with the phone idea, where you could scream to jump and to walk, you just have to rotate your phone to move your character.</h4>

                <h4>I tried to make the game for Iphone, because I have a Iphone, but that didn't work because you will need to have a Mac to export it, the developer hasn't got a Mac just like me. So I bought a new Android phone, just to work on the game and it was alot of fun to work on it, I learned alot from the experience and would like to try it again.</h4>
