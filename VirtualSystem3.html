After Glitch has been missing for a few days, they are trying to search for him. Who has him kidnapped, is someone trying to send a message? or is something else at play here?</h2>

                <h2>Even if I finished 2 chapters, I will never finish the 3rd one, because I am sick and tired working on this, because there are other things I want to work on before I end this. I can reconize there are some funny moments there, but I think they are a bit immature and not quite great. Maybe I will rework this game to make it better, but don't be surprised if there is no chapter 3.</h2>
                <h2>But while development, I had quite some trouble making characters, even the names inside of the game got more and more rediculous. When developing Chapter 3, I even had made the battle system alot better then what I had done before. I even thought of a making a entire universe around the games I made. I still have them in mind, but maybe I will work on that later.</h2>
                <h2>This game even had alot of last minute ideas, making the game complete random, like how the main character died, it felt so random. So I didn't pay attention to this game until I pulled the plug, I actually had to do it before it became more random.</h2>
