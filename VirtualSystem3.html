                <h4>Several years went by after Z3R0 returned to the void. The old cast has grown and have their own lives going on. Until an new and improved Rija System has been released. After Glitch has been missing for a few days, they are trying to search for him. Who has him kidnapped, is someone trying to send a message? or is something else at play here?</h4>

                <h4>Even if I finished 2 chapters, I will never finish the 3rd one, because I am sick and tired working on this, because there are other things I want to work on before I end this. I can reconize there are some funny moments there, but I think they are a bit immature and not quite great. Maybe I will rework this game to make it better, but don't be surprised if there is no chapter 3.</h4>
                <h4>But while development, I had quite some trouble making characters, even the names inside of the game got more and more rediculous. When developing Chapter 3, I even had made the battle system alot better then what I had done before. I even thought of a making a entire universe around the games I made. I still have them in mind, but maybe I will work on that later.</h4>
                <h4>This game even had alot of last minute ideas, making the game complete random, like how the main character died, it felt so random. So I didn't pay attention to this game until I pulled the plug, I actually had to do it before it became more random.</h4>
