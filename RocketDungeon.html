                <h4>Before working on this game, we also had decided to make a horror game, but my teammates decided against it, because it would be more difficult working on that. So we went for making a 2D game.</h4>
                <h4>Next to this text is the code what I used for the enemy behaviour, I was quite happy with the result for how the enemy reacted to the player.</h4>
                <h4>We had planned for making more levels, but we didn't went through with it, because we wanted to work on something else. I even fixed a bug I didn't even know how I fixed it, which was quite funny.</h4>
                <h4>On further note, I had no problem and no particular errors we were concerned over, because we would know how to deal with those issues at the time when making that game.</h4>

                <h4>This game was made for the 3rd period and was the first game I made with other people inside of Unity. Which was fun, to be honest. But I had to put my teammates to work, because they didn't do much before, so I said that we had to do something and we finished this game not long soon after.</h4>
