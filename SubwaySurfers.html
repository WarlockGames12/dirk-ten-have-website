                <h4>Around the time I was working on the 3D Vertical Slice, I've learned to alot of things, I've learned how to make a limited random spawner, I've learned how to put the right textures on the models, I've learned for when someone isn't doing anything to speak about it to them and if they are still not doing anything to speak to the teacher what to do.</h4>
                <h4>I had alot of issues when making the dialogue system, around the time of development, I was searching alot for how to make a dialogue system but didn't find any solutions on what I was searching for. I even tried to watch tutorials to make the dialogue system, but nothing worked. Which was frustrating for me, but eventually I finally found out why it didn't work, what I did to make it work, I could not remember, but I do know that it had something to do with when I tried applying it to the characters in game.</h4>
