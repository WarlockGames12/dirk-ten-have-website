                <h4>The Player plays as an robot that needs to get the correct combo for the crusher to combine, to create the perfect smoothie for the customers, but of course the Crusher quite hates the player so every screw up, the crusher damages you. Try to get so much smoothies out before the crusher kills you.</h4>

                <h4>In those 9 days I've worked on the game, I've worked on an dialogue system that is using an scriptable object, that has the data stored of the specific dialogue it is using, and once that dialogue is chosen in the Unity event, and gets called for, that dialogue will be played inside of the dialogue box.</h4>
                <h4>The Code was quite fun to create, which you can look right down here on how I created the code for the dialogue system.</h4>

                <h4>In this game, I even made an little inventory system, that only displays 2 items, like if the specific fruit is obtained by just walking into it, the same sprite will be instantiated on the top left of the screen, and if the player were to feed the robot, that it immediatly destroys those sprites that were instantiated on the top left, afterwards.</h4>

I had created this game all on my own, created the music and sprites all on my own an even used the sound effects from an program that everyone could use called: SFXR. </h4>
