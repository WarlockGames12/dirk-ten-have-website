                <h4>You play as an new player named SterionV that just bought a new game named the Rija System when suddenly Team Virus starts to wreak havoc, what is the meaning of this. Is there something else at play here?</h4>

                <h4>The game doesn't even work anymore, because there is something missing inside of the files and I have no idea where the project went when I wanted to fix the issue. </h4>
                <h4>Right now I really think that this game isn't great anymore what I used to think, but it was a start of everything and if I haven't made this game, I would not have been here where I am today(even though I made games in the past in a other engine before).</h4>
                <h4>And I haven't written anything on it what I could remember, I just went with the flow of the story, I didn't had any goal in mind and just kept up creating more and more.</h4>
                <div style="height: 1px; background-color: black; width: 100%; margin: 20px auto;"></div>
                <h4>I made this game more as an experiment, because it had alot of experimental elements inside it, I even tried to put alot of characters that has alot of copyright and I never thought of making more games like this.</h4>
                <h4>I even can't find the files for what I made the game for, so that's why you won't see to much in here</h4>
