                <h4>I had fun working in this project, even if there was a scuffle at first when the project started, we had a disagreement for what game we were going to remake, the artist weren't all to happy about this and they even thought of cutting the development team off (including myself) from the whole project and work on their own things, but later everything was solved and as an agreement, we made this for our Vertical Slice from the 2D version.</h4>
                <h4>I had alot of issues when making the dialogue system, around the time of development, I was searching alot for how to make a dialogue system but didn't find any solutions on what I was searching for. I even tried to watch tutorials to make the dialogue system, but nothing worked. Which was frustrating for me, but eventually I finally found out why it didn't work, what I did to make it work, I could not remember, but I do know that it had something to do with when I tried applying it to the characters in game.</h4>
