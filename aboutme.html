I really wanted to learn how to make games after I found out how one person made Five Nights at Freddy's (2014), but after I learned that you had to code, I was at first scared and thought it would be very difficult to make games on your own. So my parents thought to get to a camp that could teach me to code. I really fell in love with the coding afterwards and made 2 other games after I made my first game, but I wanted to make more, like games with stories inside of them, so I searched for other engines that could help me with that.</h2>

So I searched for another engine that could help, after a few tries to find another engine, I found and purchased RPG Maker VX on a sale on Steam. I had fun with the engine until the same things happened after I finished 2 games, people left for an other engine and so I found MV and purchased it on sale. I really liked the engine and had alot of prototypes before he released a few chapters of different games.</h2>
