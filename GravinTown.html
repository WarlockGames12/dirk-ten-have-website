                <h4>I really wanted this to work, but when I tried to work on it more, the files got corrupted and I never recovered the files after that. Even if I really wanted to make this game, I never made this a reality</h4>
                <h4>Which was really sad, because it had alot of potential, so maybe I will work on a remake that will be better then the original demo version.</h4>
                <h4>But while developing this game, I accidently made the beginning news flash scene a bit loud when I putted in the game, after I was trying the game out I jumped off my seat because it was to loud, so I had to turn it down a bit to not scare myself while playing.</h4>
                <h4>I even made art of a death inside of the game, it is kind of gruesome and alot of gore, but here it is: </h4>
