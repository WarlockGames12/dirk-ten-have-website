                <h4>You are playing a scumbag that tries to steal coins from monsters, that can pay you for a vacation, it won't be easy tho, you will have to get it with your own hands.</h4>
                <h4>Be careful not to hit the enemies, or you will be in trouble and you will be the one that will pay the price.</h4>

                <h4>Most of the things are explained in the video I made about the game, how I made it and what problems I had with it.</h4>
                <h4>I made this for a gamejam, where the theme was to finish the game where you were working on. I had alot of fun working on this game and the levels were actually hard to master to be honest, not even I can beat level 3 to begin with, maybe I will rework level 3 to make it more manageable.</h4>
                <h4>While working on this game, I also had alot of errors working on this game, like the enemy would just dissapear into thin air for some reason, but I fixed that bug and the reason the bug was there was because I missed where if the enemy flips to look the other way, it will turn 200 degrees, not 180 degrees, where it will slowly, dissapear into thin air and go behind the background art. I putted there.</h4>
                <h4>There was even a bug in the game where the pause menu buttons would not work and the bug was that I haven't made the buttons interactable, making me feel stupid once more.</h4>
